# 🛩️ Foam Glider Design 

## ✨ Overview
This was a milestone project for **ASEN 2804: Aircraft Performance and Dynamics**, where the goal was to design, fabricate, and test a **foam glider** capable of traveling the farthest distance when launched by hand. The design process included theoretical sizing of key parameters such as wingspan, tail volume, fuselage length, and incidence angle.

We conducted a case study using performance data from the Cessna 172, Boeing 737, and Tempest UAS to estimate optimal aerodynamic proportions. The final glider was built from foam board and launched from the fourth floor of an engineering building to evaluate its real-world performance.

## 👨‍💻 Personal Contributions (Damien Wilson)

- **✈️ Aircraft Sizing & Case Study**
  - Conducted comparative analysis of real aircraft (Cessna 172, Tempest, Boeing 737) to determine proportional trends in wing loading, tail volume, and aspect ratio.
  - Used this data to inform the sizing of our glider’s wing, horizontal/vertical stabilizers, and fuselage length.

- **🧮 MATLAB Calculations**
  - Implemented aerodynamic calculations and stability metrics in MATLAB to optimize flight range and control.
  - Verified center of gravity, moment arms, and tail effectiveness before construction.

- **🛠 Structural Reinforcement**
  - After our first flight test resulted in a crash, I led the effort to **reinforce the glider** with **wood spars** along the wings and tail to prevent further structural failure.
  - This change significantly improved glider durability and consistency in test throws.

- **🧾 Final Report & Presentation**
  - Co-wrote the Milestone 1 report, documenting the design process, mathematical modeling, and lessons learned from flight testing.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **MATLAB** – Used for sizing calculations, aerodynamic estimation, and static margin checks.
- **Fusion 360** – Used to CAD the final glider geometry and cross-sectional layout before fabrication.
- **Foam Board + Wood Spars** – Used to fabricate the final prototype and reinforce structural weak points.
- **Manual Launch Testing** – Thrown from a 4th floor balcony to measure glide performance and structural resilience.

## 🧠 Challenges & Key Learnings

- **Durability**: Foam alone wasn’t strong enough to handle crashes—integrating wood spars post-crash dramatically improved airworthiness.
- **Sizing Sensitivity**: Small changes in tail arm or wing loading had noticeable effects on glider trim and balance.
- **Testing Conditions**: Wind and release technique added experimental variability—repeated tests were necessary to assess performance trends.
